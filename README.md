# GOV.UK Design System Flow Diagrams for Figma

A resource to help teams show the interaction design of services.

## Adding superpowers to user-flow diagrams with Figma

For full context I have written a blog post about this Figma file, a version of the GOVUK Design System Flow Diagrams but enhanced with the capabilities of [Figma](https://figma.com).

Figma is great for creating visuals but it combines that with simple to use tools to help designers to create interactive prototypes.

The ability Figma provides to create easily customisable prototypes is what I have used to give some additional superpowers to the govuk flow diagrams we know and love.

### Easily add and customise flow steps

In other tools such as [Miro](https://miro.com), [Mural](https://mural.co), Google Draw, etc just adding the steps and customising them can be cumbersome because you need to _edit_ the graphic elements for each one.

Finding the correct layer is tricky, moving things means having to move related elements and so on. A simple wording change could lead to 5 minutes tweaking the graphic.

I've ported the flow diagram assets into Figma and then made use of features such as 'auto-layout', 'properties' and 'variants' to make this much easier.

### Add visuals for other touch points in the flow

I've seen versions of the the flow diagram where the designer has wanted to indicate something outside the digital interaction such as:

- Waiting for something
- Sending or receiving an email
- Speaking to somebody in person or on the phone

### Zooming in and out of flow detail

Interactions can sometimes be quite complex, lots of various routes and loops depending on the scenario being depicted.

This leads to very long and hard to follow diagrams. I know having produced many of them.

Using Figma's prototyping tools. You can create flows showing different levels of detail and then link to the lower level represented as a "compressed flow" which can be drawn in a separate visual (frame in Figma).

This gives impression of zooming in when following the flow diagram and means you should be able to more easily manage changes to the flow by compartmentalising sections of it and then linking them together.
